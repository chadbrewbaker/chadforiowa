    <h1>Vote Chad Brewbaker to return Iowa House to the people.</h1> 
   
    Waukee is taking Dallas County tax bribes for fake "abatements" while we pick up the tab. <br>IPERS is threatened by private equity executives.<br> It is not pro life for greving mothers to fear criminal investigation. <br>The Iowa House is filled with RINOs not humble, wise, and strong elephants. 
<br><br>
If you want to donate - freedom from government starts with personal independence. Grow a victory garden this spring - reach out for a yard sign or make your own.<br>
<br>
    <ul>   
    <li>Cap property tax abatements at 50% bringing $177m to our Dallas County schools.</li>
    <li>Uniform State stipend and IPERS to all full time licenced teachers in Iowa both public private. Keep IPERS out of private equity.</li>
    <li>Make kids fear firearms. Airsoft in Jr. High, annual round with high caliber rifle in high school PE. </li>
    <li>Make it easy to vote retirement shares by designating a proxy to take voting power from Blackrock.</li>
    <li>Respect grieving mothers who miscarry. Strong public support for a first child - normalize first child from 18-25.</li>
    </ul>
